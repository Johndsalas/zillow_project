Zillow Project

Project goal:

Create a model that can be used to predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses, using the property data from those whose last transaction was during May and June in 2017.

Secondary goal:

Determine what States and Counties those properties are in and create a distribution of tax rates for each county

Project will contain:

a jupyter notebook that details how I apply each step of the data science pipeline towards achieving the project goal and the results of the project

.py files containing the code necessary to reproduce the results of the project
