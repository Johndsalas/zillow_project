Zillow Project

Project goal:

Create a model that can be used to predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses, using the property data from those whose last transaction was during May and June in 2017.

Secondary goal:

Determine what States and Counties those properties are in and create a distribution for tax rates in each county

Project will contain:

a jupyter notebook that details how I apply each step of the data science pipeline towards achieving the project goal and the results of the project

.py files containing the code necessary to reproduce the results of the project 

Note:

First iteration of project will consider only how square feet of the home, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms can be used to estimate assessed property tax. more will be added if time permits.
